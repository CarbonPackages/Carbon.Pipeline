[![Latest stable version]][packagist] [![Download]][main.zip] [![GitHub stars]][stargazers] [![GitHub watchers]][subscription] [![GitHub license]][license] [![GitHub issues]][issues] [![GitHub forks]][network] [![Twitter]][tweet] [![Sponsor @Jonnitto on GitHub]][sponsor]

**Carbon.Pipeline is a delicious blend of [esbuild] and [PostCSS] to form a full-featured, ultra-fast modern Javascript and CSS bundler for Flow Framework and [Neos CMS].**

## Getting started

First, thank you that you want to give this build stack a try! If you miss a ‚ú® feature or found a üêõ bug, feel free to [open an issue].

### Install via [composer]

Run `composer require carbon/pipeline --dev`. Some files (if not already existing) will be copied to your root folder during the installation. After installing the package, run the command `install` to install the required packages defined in `package.json`. Feel free to modify and change dependencies before installing üëç

#### Standalone use in custom projects without Neos

Carbon.Pipeline is also a perfect choice for your non-Neos projects. Consider installing the composer package `neos/composer-plugin` beforehand to get Carbon.Pipeline installed in the correct directory under `Build/Carbon.Pipeline`.

### Manual install

If you want to make significant adjustments to the build stack, you can also [download the code as zip file][main.zip] and put it in the `Build/Carbon.Pipeline` folder. Go to `Carbon.Pipeline/RootFiles/Global` and `Carbon.Pipeline/RootFiles/JavaScript` or `Carbon.Pipeline/RootFiles/TypeScript`, copy the files to your root folder (Don't forget the hidden files, starting with a dot). After this is done, run the command `install` to install the required packages defined in `package.json`. Feel free to modify and change dependencies before installing üëç

### Choose a package manager

You can choose between different package managers: [npm], [Yarn] and the ultra-fast and disk-space saving [pnpm]. You can set your favorite package manager by running the command `pnpm setPackageManager`, `npm run setPackageManager npm` or `yarn setPackageManager yarn`. The script behind it don't need any dependencies, so you can run it before the `install` command. **The default package manager is `pnpm`**

## Add files to the build stack

Carbon.Pipeline assumes the following project directory structure for resources:

A configured location under

- `Resources/Private`: input files
- `Resources/`: output files

The whole configuration, including which files to build, is configured in [`pipeline.yaml`]. The default values are set in [`defaults.yaml`] and merged with your configuration. Under the key `packages`, you can either add an array with package settings or, if you have just one entry, you can directly add the configuration:

```yaml
packages:
  - package: Vendor.Bar
    files:
      - Main.pcss
      - Main.js

# This is the same as
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
  files:
    - Main.pcss
    - Main.js
```

If you have just one file, you can pass this directly without creating an array:

```yaml
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
  files: Main.js
```

If you don't set files, all parsable files from the input folder get rendered. Files that start with an underscore (`_`) will be ignored.

```yaml
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
```

To change the input and/or the output folder, you can do this with the `folder` option:

```yaml
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
  folder:
    input: Assets
    output:
      inline: Private/Templates
      style: Public
      script: Public
      module: Public
      commonJS: Public
```

Further, you can write the files to another package:

```yaml
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
  folder:
    output:
      package: Vendor.Theme
```

If you want to go crazy with multi-sites in Neos, you can also write the files to multiple packages:

```yaml
packages:
  package: Vendor.Bar
  folder:
    output:
      package:
        - Vendor.Theme
        - Vendor.Bar
```

A package entry has the following options:

| Key                        | Type                | Description                                                                                      | Example              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `package`                  | `string`            | The name of the package **(required)**                                                           | `Vendor.Foo`         |
| `files`                    | `string` or `array` | The names of the entry files. If none given, all parsable files in the input folder get rendered | `Main.js`            |
| `ignoredFiles`             | `string` or `array` | List of files who should be ignored                                                              | `Main.js`            |
| `folder.input`             | `string`            | The folder under `Resources/Private` where to look for the entry files                           | `Assets`             |
| `folder.output.package`    | `string` or `array` | If set, the files will be writen in a different package (one or multiple)                        | `Foo.Bar`            |
| `folder.output.inline`     | `string`            | The folder where inline files get rendered                                                       | `Private/Templates/` |
| `folder.output.style`      | `string`            | The folder where inline styles rendered                                                          | `Public/Assets`      |
| `folder.output.script`     | `string`            | The folder where inline scripts rendered                                                         | `Public/Assets`      |
| `folder.output.module`     | `string`            | The folder where inline modules rendered                                                         | `Public/Assets`      |
| `folder.output.commonJS`   | `string`            | The folder where inline commonJS files get rendered                                              | `Public/Assets`      |
| `external`                 | `string` or `array` | You can mark a file or a package as [external] to exclude it from your build.                    | `*/Modules/*`        |
| `inline`                   | `boolean`           | Flag to toggle if the files should be inlined. If set, sourcemaps are disabled                   | `true`               |
| `sourcemap`                | `boolean`           | Flag to toggle source map generation                                                             | `false`              |
| `format`                   | `string`            | Set the format of the output file. [Read more][esbuild format]                                   | `cjs`                |
| `jsFileExtension`          | `array` or `false`  | File extensions of javascript files. If set to `false`, all files will have the extension `.js`  | `false`              |
| `jsFileExtension.script`   | `string`            | File extension of script files                                                                   | `.js`                |
| `jsFileExtension.module`   | `string`            | Output extension of module JS files.                                                             | `.module`            |
| `jsFileExtension.commonJS` | `string`            | Output extension of common JS files.                                                             | `.common`            |

These are the default values for the folders:

```yaml
folder:
  input: Fusion
  output:
    inline: Private/Templates/InlineAssets
    style: Public/Styles
    script: Public/Scripts
    module: Public/Modules
    commonJS: Public/CommonJS
```

and these for the build options:

```yaml
external: null
inline: false
sourcemap: true
format: iife
jsFileExtension:
  script: .js
  module: .mjs
  commonJS: .cjs
```

The target folders can be adjusted under the key `folder.output`. If you want to change the defaults for all your packages, you can also set this globally in your [`pipeline.yaml`]:

```yaml
folder:
  input: Assets
  output:
    inline: Private/Templates
    style: Public
    script: Public
    module: Public
    commonJS: Public

buildDefaults:
  sourcemap: false
  format: esm
```

Please look at the [`defaults.yaml`] file for all the options.

If you set an entry file with the javascript module suffix (`.mjs`, `.mjsx`, `.mts` or `.mtsx`) the format of this file will be enforced to `esm`. The same with commonJS: If you set an entry file with the javascript commonJS suffix (`.cjs`, `.cjsx`, `.cts` or `.ctsx`) the format of this file will be enforced to `cjs`. E.g., if you have the following array `["Main.js", "Module.mjs", "CommonJS.cjs"]`, and have no specific setting for the format, `Main.js` will have the format `iife`, `Module.mjs` will have the format `esm` and `CommonJS.cjs` will have the format `cjs`.

## Tasks

**As you can choose your favorite package manager, you have to prepend the task name with the corresponding name (`pnpm`, `yarn` or `npm run`)**

There are five predefined main tasks:

| Command             | Description                                                                 | Command                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `watch`             | Start the file watcher                                                      | `concurrently -r pnpm:watch:*`                    |
| `dev`               | Build the files once                                                        | `concurrently -r pnpm:dev:*`                      |
| `build`             | Build the files once for production (with optimzed file size)               | `concurrently -r pnpm:build:*`                    |
| `pipeline`          | Run install, and build the files for production                             | `pnpm install;concurrently -r pnpm:pipeline:*`    |
| `showConfig`        | Shows the merged configuration from [`pipeline.yaml`] and [`defaults.yaml`] | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/showConfig.mjs`       |
| `setPackageManager` | [Set your package manager.]                                                 | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/setPackageManager.js` |

The tasks are split up, so they can run in parallel mode. But you can also run them separately:

| Command          | Description                                                   | Command                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `watch:js`       | Start the file watcher for JavaScript files                   | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/esbuild.mjs --watch`      |
| `watch:css`      | Start the file watcher for CSS files                          | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/postcss.mjs --watch`      |
| `dev:js`         | Build the files once for JavaScript files                     | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/esbuild.mjs`              |
| `dev:css`        | Build the files once for CSS files                            | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/postcss.mjs`              |
| `build:js`       | Build the JavaScript files once for production                | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/esbuild.mjs --production` |
| `build:css`      | Build the CSS files once for production                       | `node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/postcss.mjs --production` |
| `pipeline:build` | Build the files once for production (with optimzed file size) | `concurrently -r pnpm:build:*`                        |

### Extendibility

Of course, you can also add your own tasks in the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file. For example, if you have a Neos UI custom editor and want to start all your tasks in one place, you can add them like this:

```json
{
  "build:editor": "pnpm --dir DistributionPackages/Foo.Editor/Resources/Private/Editor/ build",
  "watch:editor": "pnpm --dir DistributionPackages/Foo.Editor/Resources/Private/Editor/ watch",
  "pipeline:editor": "pnpm --dir DistributionPackages/Foo.Editor/Resources/Private/Editor/ install",
}
```

> Be aware that you may have different syntax for settings options based on the chosen task manager
> To set the current work directory, for example you have to set `--cwd` for `yarn`, `--dir` or `-C` for `pnpm` and `--prefix` for `npm`.

Because the tasks start with `build:`, respectively with `watch:` or `pipeline:`, the tasks will be included in the corresponding root command. In this example, `build`, `watch` or `pipeline`. If you want to go crazy, you can even mix different task managers.

## Compression of files

In production mode (`build`), the files also get compressed with [gzip] and [brotli]. You can edit the compression level under the key [`buildDefaults.compression`]. Per default, the highest compression level is set. To disable compression at all, you can set it to `false`:

```yaml
buildDefaults:
  compression: false
```

Or, if you want to disable just one of them, you can set the entry to `false`:

```yaml
buildDefaults:
  compression:
    gzip: false
```

## Import files from DistributionPackages and other Packages

By default, two aliases are predefined: `DistributionPackages` and `Packages`. Like that you can import (CSS and JS) files from other packages like that:

```js
import "DistributionPackages/Vendor.Foo/Resources/Private/Fusion/Main";
import "Packages/Plugins/Jonnitto.PhotoSwipe/Resources/Private/Assets/PhotoSwipe";
```

```css
@import "DistributionPackages/Vendor.Foo/Resources/Private/Fusion/Main.pcss";
@import "Packages/Carbon/Carbon.Image/Resources/Private/Assets/Tailwind.pcss";
```

Thanks to a custom made `resolve` function, you can also use [globbing][glob] in CSS imports: `@import "Presentation/**/*.pcss";`

## Alter the configuration file

In some setups, you may need multiple configurations with different config files. In this edge case, you can set a other config file in your `scripts` section in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "build:custom:css": "node Build/Carbon.Pipeline/postcss.mjs --configFile=pipelineCustom.yaml"
}
```

In this example, `pipelineCustom.yaml` gets used instead of `pipeline.yaml`.

## CSS

### Sass

If you want to use [Sass] (`.scss`or `.sass` files) you have to install [`sass`] and [`node-sass-tilde-importer`]:

For [pnpm]:

```bash
pnpm add -D sass node-sass-tilde-importer
```

For [Yarn]:

```bash
yarn add --dev sass node-sass-tilde-importer
```

For [npm]:

```bash
npm add -D sass node-sass-tilde-importer
```

You have to ways to import files from `node_modules` (Example with bootstrap):

```css
@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Pass options to the sass compiler</strong></summary>

You can pass options to the sass compiler with `sassOptions`.

**Example**:
To silence warnings from stylesheets loaded through importers and load paths, you can enable `quietDeps`:

```yaml
sassOptions:
  quietDeps: true
```

</details>

### PostCSS

This template comes with a variety of PostCSS Plugins. Feel free to remove some or add your own favorite packages. The configuration is located in [`.postcssrc.mjs`]. The suffix of these files should be `.pcss`.

#### Pass custom options to you PostCSS config file

You can pass custom options to your PostCSS config file with key `postcssOptions`. In this example, you would access the key `prefix` with `ctx.prefix` in your PostCSS config file (`.postcssrc.mjs`).

```yaml
postcssOptions:
  prefix: true
```

#### Use postcss resolve() function

You can use `resolve()` in your css/scss files to load resources (eg images) from `Resources/Public` of the package. The path will be resolved at compile-time.

```css
.my-class {
  background-image: resolve('Images/my-image.jpg')
}
```

resolves to

```css
.my-class {
  background-image: url('/_Resources/Static/Packages/Your.Package/Images/my-image.jpg')
}
```

If you choose to order your Packages in DistributionPackages in subfolders, you can add this setting to ensure the paths are correctly rewritten:

```yaml
postcssOptions:
  additionalPackagePathPrefixes:
    - Sites
    - Plugins
```

This ensures that the path that is generated (eg `/_Resources/Static/Packages/(Sites|Plugins)/Your.Package/.../`) will be correctly resolved, removing the subfolder from the path.

#### PostCSS Plugins

<details>
<summary><strong>Following plugins are included:</strong></summary>

| Name                         | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [postcss-reporter]           | `console.log()` the messages (warnings, etc.) registered by other PostCSS plugins                                      |

Of course, you can add your own or remove not-needed Plugins as you want. This is just meant as a starting point.

</details>

### Tailwind CSS

This setup comes with [Tailwind CSS], a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework. An example configuration is provided in [`tailwind.config.mjs`]. The setup for get the content for the CSS files is also configured. [Read more about controlling the file size here][optimizing-for-production]. To remove a specific package, you could use this pattern in your `pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml
buildDefaults:
  content:
    RemovePacakge: "!DistributionPackages/Package.ToRemove"
```

By default, following entries are pre-defined:

```yaml
buildDefaults:
  content:
    DistributionPackages: DistributionPackages/**/(Private|NodeTypes)/**/*.{fusion,html,js,jsx,ts,tsx,mjs,mjsx,mts,mtsx,cjs,cjsx,cts,ctsx,svelte,vue}
    ignoreNodeModules: '!DistributionPackages/**/Private/**/node_modules'
```

The script put automatically all entries starting with an `!` at the end of the list. You can control this setting by calling `pnpm showConfig --path=buildDefaults.content`

By the way: [Alpine.js] is excellent in combination with [Tailwind CSS].

## Javascript

<details>
<summary><strong>Flow Settings in Javascript</strong></summary>

Suppose you use tools like [Flownative.Sentry], you perhaps want to pass some of the settings to your Javascript without setting a `data` attribute somewhere in the markup. For that, you can enable `esbuild.defineFlowSettings`. If set to `true`, all settings are passed. It is recommended to put it to a path (e.g. `Flownative.Sentry`). This path is added as `--path` attribute to the `flow configuration:show` command. If you run the command `build`, which automatically has the flag `--production`, the `FLOW_CONTEXT` is set to `Production`.

```yaml
esbuild:
  defineFlowSettings: Flownative.Sentry
```

In Javascript, you can access the variables like this:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: FLOW.Flownative.Sentry.dsn,
  release: FLOW.Flownative.Sentry.release,
  environment: FLOW.Flownative.Sentry.environment,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
});
```

Make sure your [`eslint.config.mjs`] has the global `FLOW` enabled:

```js
import globals from "globals";
import pluginJs from "@eslint/js";
import prettierRecommended from "eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended";

export default [
    pluginJs.configs.recommended,
    prettierRecommended,
    {
        ignores: ["Build/", "Packages/", "**/Public/", "**/Resources/Private/Templates/", "*.noLinter.*"],
        languageOptions: {
            globals: {

                ...globals.node,
                FLOW: "readonly",
            },
        },
    },
];

<summary><strong>Pass options to esbuild</strong></summary>

You can pass options to the [esbuild API] with `esbuild.options`.

**Example**:
To remove some functions from the production build, you can use the `esbuild.options.pure` setting. If you have just
one function, you can pass a string; otherwise, you have to set it to an array:

```yaml
esbuild:
  options:
    pure:
      - console.log
      - console.pure
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>TypeScript</strong></summary>

If you want to use [TypeScript], just choose the option TypeScript on the composer installation

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>React</strong></summary>

Using JSX syntax usually requires you to manually import the JSX library you are using. For example, if you are using [React], by default, you will need to import React into each JSX file like this:

```js
import * as React from "react";
render(<div />);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Preact</strong></summary>

If you're using JSX with a library other than React (such as [Preact],), you'll likely need to configure the [JSX factory] and [JSX fragment] settings since they default to `React.createElement`and `React.Fragment` respectively. Add this to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsxFactory": "h",
    "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Svelte</strong></summary>

If you want to use [Svelte], add the following packages to `package.json`:

For [pnpm]:

```bash
pnpm add -D svelte svelte-preprocess esbuild-svelte @tsconfig/svelte
```

For [Yarn]:

```bash
yarn add --dev svelte svelte-preprocess esbuild-svelte @tsconfig/svelte
```

For [npm]:

```bash
npm add -D svelte svelte-preprocess esbuild-svelte @tsconfig/svelte
```

Enable the plugin in your [`pipeline.yaml`] file:

```yaml
esbuild:
  plugins:
    svelte:
      enable: true
      # Name of the esbuild plugin for svelte
      # plugin: esbuild-svelte
      # Name of the preprocess plugin
      # preprocess: svelte-preprocess
      # Add here your options
      options:
        compilerOptions:
          # external or injected
          css: external
```

> You can also configure the esbuild plugin and preprocess package, which should be used. Just add a key `plugin` or `preprocess` and the plugin name.

Your `tsconfig.json` may look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/svelte/tsconfig.json",
  "include": ["DistributionPackages/**/Private/*"],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules/*",
    "__sapper__/*",
    "DistributionPackages/**/Public/*",
    "DistributionPackages/**/Private/Templates/InlineAssets*",
    "Packages"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "Packages/*": ["Packages/*"],
      "DistributionPackages/*": ["DistributionPackages/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vue.js</strong></summary>

If you want to use [Vue.js], add the following packages to `package.json`:

For [pnpm]:

```bash
pnpm add -D vue esbuild-plugin-vue3
```

For [Yarn]:

```bash
yarn add --dev vue esbuild-plugin-vue3
```

For [npm]:

```bash
npm add -D vue esbuild-plugin-vue3
```

Enable the plugin in your [`pipeline.yaml`] file:

```yaml
esbuild:
  plugins:
    vue:
      enable: true
      # Name of the esbuild plugin for Vue
      # plugin: esbuild-plugin-vue3
      # You can pass your needed options here
      # options:
```

> You can also configure the esbuild plugin, which should be used. Just add a key `plugin` and add the plugin name.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Babel.js / IE 11 support</strong></summary>

If you want to use [Babel.js], add the following packages to `package.json`:

For [pnpm]:

```bash
pnpm add -D @babel/core esbuild-plugin-babel
```

For [Yarn]:

```bash
yarn add --dev @babel/core esbuild-plugin-babel
```

For [npm]:

```bash
npm add -D @babel/core esbuild-plugin-babel
```

as well as additonals babel plugins and/or presets like `@babel/preset-env`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread`

Further, you have to add a file called `babel.config.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "modules": false
      }
    ]
  ],
  "plugins": ["@babel/proposal-class-properties", "@babel/proposal-object-rest-spread"]
}
```

Finally, enable the plugin in your [`pipeline.yaml`] file:

```yaml
esbuild:
  plugins:
    babel:
      enable: true
      # You can pass your needed options here
      # options:
```

As the `ENV` variable is set to `development` or `production` if you run the tasks, you can have different setups (For example remove `console` commands with [`babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`] on `production`):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "presets": [
        [
          "@babel/preset-env",
          {
            "modules": false
          }
        ]
      ],
      "plugins": ["@babel/proposal-class-properties", "@babel/proposal-object-rest-spread"]
    },
    "production": {
      "presets": [
        [
          "@babel/preset-env",
          {
            "modules": false
          }
        ]
      ],
      "plugins": ["@babel/proposal-class-properties", "@babel/proposal-object-rest-spread", "transform-remove-console"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you are a poor person and have to support Internet Explorer, you must edit your `.browserslistrc`.
If a browser starting with `ie` is found, the target `es5` gets activated.

```
defaults
ie 11
not dead
```

</details>
<details>

<summary><strong>Additional esbuild plugins</strong></summary>

You can also add additional [esbuild] plugins, for example [`esbuild-envfile-plugin`]:

```yaml
esbuild:
  additionalPlugins:
    esbuild-envfile-plugin:
      functionName: setup
      options: null
```

As the plugin returns not the function directly (like others), you also have to pass the function's name.
If a plugin returns the function directly, you don't have to set this. If you want to enable such a plugin without any options, you can just pass `name-of-the-plugin: true`

</details>

## Live-Reloading

If you want to use live reloading, you can do this with [Browsersync].

To install it run `pnpm add --global browser-sync`, `yarn global add browser-sync`, or `npm install -g browser-sync`.

Then you have to create an initial config with `browser-sync init`.
After that, you need to adjust the created `bs-config.js` file.
You can adjust every parameter, but the two parameter you need to set is `files` and `proxy`:

```js
module.exports = {
  files: ["DistributionPackages/**/Public/**/*.css", "DistributionPackages/**/Public/**/*.js"],
  proxy: "http://your.local.domain",
};
```

If you want to also reload the page if a `fusion` or a template file gets changed, you can do so:

```js
module.exports = {
  files: [
    "DistributionPackages/**/Public/**/*.css",
    "DistributionPackages/**/Public/**/*.js",
    "DistributionPackages/**/Private/**/*.fusion",
    "DistributionPackages/**/Private/**/*.html",
  ],
  proxy: "http://your.local.domain",
};
```

Make sure you set the correct proxy with the corresponding protocol (`https://` or `http://`), depending on your setup. To create a better overview of the parameter, you can delete the not changed values from the file.

To start Browsersync you can run `browser-sync start --config bs-config.js`. If you want to start it together with `watch`, you can add the following line into the `scripts` section:

```json
{
  "watch:browsersync": "browser-sync start --config bs-config.js",
}
```
